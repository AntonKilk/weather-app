# Implement Plan

**Plan**: $ARGUMENTS

## Your Mission

Execute the plan end-to-end with rigorous self-validation.

**Core Philosophy**: Validation loops catch mistakes early. Run checks after every change. Fix issues immediately.

**Golden Rule**: If validation fails, fix it before moving on. Never accumulate broken state.

---

## Phase 1: LOAD

### Read CLAUDE.md

Before reading the plan, read `CLAUDE.md` and note:

- **Validation commands** — exact lint, build, test commands for this project (use these everywhere, never assume pnpm/npm/go/mvn)
- **Architecture rules** — layer boundaries, dependency direction, DDD grouping; every file you create must respect these
- **Security checklist** — input validation at boundaries, no hardcoded secrets, proper error messages
- **Fault tolerance rules** — timeouts on external calls, retry policy, idempotency requirements
- **Database rules** — migration tool in use, repository pattern

If `CLAUDE.md` links to a tech-design or architecture doc (e.g. `.agents/tech-design.md`),
read it too before writing code. **Build strictly on the locked-in stack** (language,
framework, datastore, hosting) — never substitute a different technology because it feels
more familiar or because a plan snippet used a different one.

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, stop and ask the user to run `/create-rules` first.

### Read the Plan

Load the plan file and extract:

- **Summary** - What we're building
- **Patterns to Mirror** - Code to copy from
- **Files to Change** - CREATE/UPDATE list
- **Tasks** - Implementation order
- **Validation Commands** - How to verify (cross-check with CLAUDE.md)
- **GitHub Issue** - Check the plan's Metadata table for a GitHub Issue number (e.g., `#5`). If present, this issue will be updated after implementation is complete.

**If plan not found:**
```
Error: Plan not found at $ARGUMENTS
Create a plan first: /plan "feature description"
```

---

## Phase 2: PREPARE

### Git State

```bash
git branch --show-current
git status
```

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| On main, clean | Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/{plan-name}` |
| On main, dirty | STOP: "Stash or commit changes first" |
| On feature branch | Use it |

---

## Phase 3: EXECUTE

**For each task in the plan:**

### 3.1 Verify Assumptions

Before writing any code for a task:

- **Read the target file** you're about to create or modify
- **Read adjacent files** — files it imports from, and files that import it
- **Verify the plan's references** — do the functions, interfaces, tables, or endpoints the plan mentions actually exist? Do they match the plan's expectations?
- **If assumptions are wrong**, adapt your approach before implementing. Document what differs from the plan.

### 3.2 Implement

- Read the **MIRROR** file reference and understand the pattern to follow
- Make the change as specified in the plan
- **Check integration**: verify your change connects correctly to adjacent code — do imports resolve? Do callers/callees still work? Does the data flow correctly across boundaries?

### 3.3 Validate Immediately

**After EVERY task** — use the commands from `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
{build/type-check command from CLAUDE.md}
```

**If it fails:**
1. Read the error
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run validation
4. Only proceed when passing

### 3.4 Track Progress

```
Task 1: CREATE src/x.ts ✅
Task 2: UPDATE src/y.ts ✅
```

**If you deviate from the plan**, document what changed and why.

---

## Phase 4: VALIDATE

### Run All Checks

Use the exact commands from `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
{lint command}
{type check / build command}
{test command}
```

**All must pass with zero errors.**

**Evidence rule**: capture the real output of every command (exit code + key lines) —
you will paste it into the report. A ✅ without the output that produced it is a claim,
not a result.

### Write Tests

You MUST write tests for new code:
- Every new function needs at least one test
- Error cases and edge cases need tests
- Update existing tests if behavior changed
- **Test across boundaries** — don't just test functions in isolation. If you added an API endpoint, test that the endpoint returns the correct response shape and data. If you added a service method, test that it integrates correctly with its callers.

**If tests fail:**
1. Determine: bug in implementation or test?
2. Fix the actual issue
3. Re-run until green

### REQUIRED: End-to-End Verification

> **⚠️ Do NOT proceed to Phase 5 (Report) until all E2E steps below pass.**

Re-read the plan and find the end-to-end testing section. Execute every E2E test listed in the plan as a checklist:

- [ ] Start the application (dev servers, databases, etc.)
- [ ] For EACH end-to-end test in the plan:
  - [ ] Execute the test exactly as described
  - [ ] Verify the expected outcome matches the plan
  - [ ] If it fails: fix the issue, re-run, confirm it passes
- [ ] Confirm all E2E tests pass before proceeding

**If the plan has no E2E tests**, perform a basic smoke test: start the app, exercise the new/changed feature manually, verify it works.

**This is a hard gate.** You cannot report the implementation as complete until E2E verification passes. Static checks and unit tests alone are never sufficient.

For each E2E test record: the command/action performed and what it actually returned —
this goes into the report as evidence.

---

## Phase 4.5: INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION (second opinion)

> **⚠️ Hard gate. You wrote this code — you do not get to be the one who signs it off.**

Dispatch the **`verifier`** subagent (fresh context, defined in `.claude/agents/verifier.md`)
via the `Agent` tool:

- `subagent_type`: `verifier`
- `prompt`: the plan path, the branch name, and the claimed status. Instruct it to try
  to **refute** completeness and correctness.

The verifier independently re-runs validation and inspects the diff against the plan,
then returns `VERDICT: CONFIRMED | REFUTED` with evidence.

| Verdict | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `CONFIRMED` | Proceed to Phase 5. Include the verdict + evidence in the report. |
| `REFUTED` | Fix every finding, re-run Phase 4 checks, dispatch the verifier again. |

**Max 3 verification rounds.** Still REFUTED after 3 → stop, report status as
`INCOMPLETE` with the outstanding findings. Never report COMPLETE over a REFUTED verdict.

---

## Phase 5: REPORT

### Create Report

**Output path**: `.agents/reports/{plan-name}-report.md`

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/reports
```

```markdown
# Implementation Report

**Plan**: `{plan-path}`
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Status**: COMPLETE

## Summary

{Brief description of what was implemented}

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | File | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | {description} | `src/x.ts` | ✅ |
| 2 | {description} | `src/y.ts` | ✅ |

## Validation Evidence

| Check | Command | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Type check | `{command}` | exit 0 |
| Lint | `{command}` | exit 0 |
| Tests | `{command}` | {N} passed, 0 failed |

```
{key lines of actual test/lint output — the evidence, not just the verdict}
```

## Independent Verification

**Verdict**: CONFIRMED (round {n} of max 3)

{Verifier's EVIDENCE and any UNVERIFIABLE items, verbatim}

## E2E Evidence

| Test | Action performed | Observed result |
|------|------------------|-----------------|
| {name} | `{command/action}` | {what it returned} |

## Files Changed

| File | Action | Lines |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/x.ts` | CREATE | +{N} |
| `src/y.ts` | UPDATE | +{N}/-{M} |

## Deviations from Plan

{List any deviations with rationale, or "None"}

## Tests Written

| Test File | Test Cases |
|-----------|------------|
| `src/x.test.ts` | {list} |
```

### Archive Plan

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/plans/completed
mv $ARGUMENTS .agents/plans/completed/
```

---

## Phase 6: UPDATE GITHUB ISSUE (if issue specified in plan)

**This phase is mandatory if the plan's Metadata table contains a GitHub Issue number.** Skip only if the GitHub Issue field is "N/A" or absent.

### 6.1 Add Implementation Comment

Call `mcp__github__add_issue_comment` with:
- `owner` and `repo`: read from `git remote get-url origin` or `CLAUDE.md`
- `issue_number`: The issue number from the plan (e.g., `5`)
- `body`: A summary in markdown including:
  - What was implemented
  - Branch name
  - Files created/updated (count)
  - Tests written (count)
  - Any deviations from the plan
  - Link to the implementation report file path

### 6.2 Close the Issue (when fully done)

If all tasks in the plan are complete, call `mcp__github__issue_write` with:
- `method`: `"update"`
- `owner` and `repo`: read from `git remote get-url origin` or `CLAUDE.md`
- `issue_number`: The issue number from the plan
- `state`: `"closed"`
- `state_reason`: `"completed"`

---

## Phase 7: OUTPUT

```markdown
## Implementation Complete

**Plan**: `{plan-path}`
**Branch**: `{branch-name}`
**Status**: ✅ Complete

### Validation

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Type check | exit 0 |
| Lint | exit 0 |
| Tests | {N} passed |
| Independent verification | CONFIRMED (round {n}) |

### Files Changed

- {N} files created
- {M} files updated
- {K} tests written

### Deviations

{Summary or "Implementation matched the plan."}

### Artifacts

- Report: `.agents/reports/{name}-report.md`
- Plan archived: `.agents/plans/completed/`

### GitHub Issue

{If issue was updated: "Updated #ISSUE_NUMBER: added implementation comment, issue closed." Otherwise: "No GitHub Issue linked."}

### Next Steps

1. Review the report
2. Create PR: `gh pr create`
3. Merge when approved
```

---

## Handling Failures

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Type check fails | Read error, fix issue, re-run |
| Tests fail | Fix implementation or test, re-run |
| Lint fails | Run lint --fix if supported, then manual fixes |
| Build fails | Check error output, fix and re-run |
| Verifier returns REFUTED | Fix every finding, re-run Phase 4, re-dispatch verifier (max 3 rounds, then report INCOMPLETE) |
